### Prerequisites (Only required for manual installation)
* *[Python 3.10.X+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (May not work on older Python versions)*<br>
> ***Note:** When installing Python, please note to check the `Add Python to Path` option.*

Simply run the script and enter the options as prompted. If you have never used a terminal program before, there will be times where you are prompted for input, just type your response and press enter to submit.

### Installation / Usage (Automatic)

#### *Step 1. Download the [latest](https://github.com/ShoobyDoo/League-of-Locales/releases/latest) release `leagueoflocales3.X.X.exe` .*

> ***Note:** If the release does not have a prebuilt binary (exe), you will have to use the manual installation method instead.*

#### *Step 2. Run the executable and follow the prompts.*
> ***Note:** From this point, once you had launched `leagueoflocales3.X.X.exe`, the process is the exact same as in the manual installation. See the Gifs below if you need further guidance.*

### Installation / Usage (Manual)

#### *Step 1. Download the [latest](https://github.com/ShoobyDoo/League-of-Locales/releases/latest) release source code `leagueoflocales3.X.X-src.zip`. and extract it to your desired folder. For the examples shown below, I just extract it to my desktop.*

#### *Step 2. Start the program by double clicking leagueoflocales.py*

> ***Note:** If the program does not start after double clicking, you can open the windows terminal, navigate to where you downloaded League Of Locales.* See below:

#### *Step 3. Select your desired locale. (Remember you can always change this anytime you want... Don't like Korean anymore? Switch back to English, etc.)*

As you might've noticed, League of Locales pretty much does the heavy lifting from this point on, however a few things to note:
* League of Locales will automatically try to find your League of Legends install directory, if it fails to do so, you will be prompted to enter the directory manually.
* League of Locales will also create a configuration file which it will read from when you launch the program. This file will be located in the same directory as the program itself, and will be named lol.ini.

#### *Step 4. All the setup pieces are complete, you can now start the client.*

From the menu, type `1` and press `ENTER` or just press `ENTER` without typing anything and it will launch the client, forcing it to your desired locale. See Below:
